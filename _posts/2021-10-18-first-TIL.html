<p>Never in all their history have men been able truly to conceive of the world as one: a single sphere, a globe, having the qualities of a globe, a round earth in which all the directions eventually meet, in which there is no center because every point, or none, is center — an equal earth which all men occupy as equals. The airman's earth, if free men make it, will be truly round: a globe in practice, not in theory.</p>

<p>Science cuts two ways, of course; its products can be used for both good and evil. But there's no turning back from science. The early warnings about technological dangers also come from science.</p>

<p>What was most significant about the lunar voyage was not that man set foot on the Moon but that they set eye on the earth.</p>

<p>A Chinese tale tells of some men sent to harm a young girl who, upon seeing her beauty, become her protectors rather than her violators. That's how I felt seeing the Earth for the first time. I could not help but love and cherish her.</p>

<p>For those who have seen the Earth from space, and for the hundreds and perhaps thousands more who will, the experience most certainly changes your perspective. The things that we share in our world are far more valuable than those which divide us.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">The Final Frontier</h2>

<p>There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow. Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next ten.</blockquote>

<p>Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Reaching for the Stars</h2>

<p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>

<p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.</p>

<p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>

<h2>시작하기에 앞서</h2>

<p>Today I Learned를 기록으로 남기기 전에 내가 TIL를 통해서 얻어가야 할 것을 확실히 해두자.</p>

<p>    1. 배움의 증거</p>

<p>개발자분들은 오래전부터 TIL, 오픈소스 제작, 1일 1커밋 등을 통해 자신이 배운 것을 기록으로 남겨왔다고 들었다. 이러한 기록은 취직, 이직 등의 상황에서 이점으로 작용하는 점도 있겠지만, 내가 배운것이 제대로 기억이 안날 때 당장이라도 꺼내어 볼 수 있는 훌륭한 아카이브가 되어 줄 수 도 있다고 생각한다.</p>

<p>    2. 습관</p>

<p>꾸준함은 강력한 무기라고 생각한다. 코딩 공부를 습관화시켜 꾸준히 내 실력을 발전시키고 싶다.</p>

<p>    3. 동기부여</p>

<p>2번과 밀접하게 연결되어있는 내용이다. 습관을 만들기 위해서 목표를 세우고, 그 목표를 따라가는 방법을 이용해보려한다.</p>

<h2>목표 설정</h2>

<p>목표는 계속해서 추가되거나 바뀌겠지만, 지금 당장 세운 목표들을 먼저 나열해보자.</p>

<p>- html이 아닌 마크다운으로 포스팅 할 수 있는 환경 구축</p>

<p>- 복잡한 홈페이지 카피본 만들어보기</p>

<p>- 나만의 아이디어로 홈페이지 만들어보기</p>

<p>개발자가 되기 위해 힘내자.</p>
